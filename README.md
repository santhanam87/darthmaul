This repository is not a library, tutorial, or any kind of tool which you can use for your need, this is like a chest that carries all my experience and thought processes. It will not deliver you a completed product, instead, this will deliver you information about all my efforts towards achieving something new from the scratch.

## FAQ

### How different is it from a library?

The intention behind this is not to deliver some utilities or tools for web development, instead, it should be like an empirical log that provides information about my learning and understanding of the goal.

The goal is not always building JS components or utility methods, it can be the best practices, a common standard, exploration of a tool, etc., so it can be anything related to web development.

### How the work be organized?

That’s the mystery I am yet to figure out. My anticipation is once I have an active contribution, at some point, it may be worth information for people who are striving forward in this software development world.

### What value does it provide?

Experience is my best teacher, Internet is flooded with so many good tutorials but what I find lacking is displaying honest effort in trying to do something from your thought process, whenever I try something the anticipation is to get the best out of it, but it is not possible without persistence and continuous learning. This “observe and engage” process will be documented as part of this repo. Which eventually become a corpus of my observation and approach.

### What are the tech, tools will be covered ?

For now, the main stack I have in mind is React, Node, Redux, RTL Query, GraphQL, Webkit, and Jest. All this stack will be served under Express server with Server Side Rendering. Another key thing I like to explore as part of this is Testing and Refactoring.

### Why the name Darthmaul ?

When it comes to naming, I really like to pick it based on relevance, Maul is a star wars character who showed great perseverance in achieving the goal, no matter what he stayed till to meet his goal, this repo should represent something similar to that.
